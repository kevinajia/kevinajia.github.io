      <description>Most of my Python skills were developed through various other classes I have taken through the elements of computing certificate. Some of these classes include data structures, software engineering, databases, and web programming. However I did pickup a few new skills from this class, including exposure to pandas and other Python libraries, and learning how to have R and python talk to each other with reticulate.
I learned that to look at datasets in Python, you must import pandas, a software library that is used for data manipulation and analysis.</description>
